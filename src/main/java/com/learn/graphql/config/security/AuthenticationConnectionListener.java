     Q: Why do not set the token/Authentication inside Spring Security SecurityContextHolder here?

     If the start frame is not sent directly with the connection_init then the two frames may be serviced on different threads.
     The thread servicing the connection_init frame will check the websocket for any further inbound frames,
     if false the thread will move onto another websocket. Another thread is then free to service the following start frame.
     In this case, that thread not have the security context of the correct session/thread.

     Same scenario happens for onStop. (Message can be executed on different thread).

     This seems to be why some users are reporting intermittent failures with spring security.
     E.g. https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-java-servlet/discussions/134#discussioncomment-225980

     With the NIO connector, a small number of threads will check sessions for new frames.
     If a session has a frame available, the session will be passed to another thread pool which will read frame, execute it, check for another frame, execute it (loop).
     The session will be released when there are no further frames available. With this, we know that at most one thread will concurrently access one socket,
     therefore frames will be read sequentially. We can therefore extract the auth credentials from onConnect and add them to the session.getUserProperties().
     These properties are available in the onStart and onStop callbacks. Inside these callbacks, we can add the token to the SecurityContextHolder if we decide to use method level security,
     or simply access the credentials inside the subscription resolver via DataFetchingEnvironment.
